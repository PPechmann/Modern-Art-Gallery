### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop First Workflow

### What I learned

Learned more about CSS Grid, as I solely used to position elements with the grid-area. Again got an example of how important it is
to plan a project fully from the beginning.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
